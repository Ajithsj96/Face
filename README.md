Facial-Expression-Recognition
=============================

An OpenCV application which uses the Eigen Face Model for Recognizing Facial Expression Recognition.

The system was developed as a Summer Intern Project at SVNIT.
 
It is a real-time facial expression recognition system using a simple approach.

To use this, the user, needs to first install OpenCV libraries on their system. Tutorial for it: http://computerseye.wordpress.com/2014/06/19/install-opencv-in-ubuntu-2/

Once, openCV is installed, run the train.cpp fill. The Terminal will prompt to enter your name and then, show facial Expressions one by one. Simple press one and demonstrate the expression.

Once, ready, run the again.cpp and pass YourNAME.csv as command line input. 

And you are done! The system will start recognizing the expressions in real time. Press ctrl+C to exit. A folder called HelloWorld would be created and it will contain the Eigen Faces.
